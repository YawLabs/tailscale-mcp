/**
 * Runtime launcher for @yawlabs/tailscale-mcp.
 *
 * Prefers the oam runtime (https://oamjs.org) and falls back to the Node
 * process already running this file.
 *
 *
 * WHY THE FALLBACK COSTS NOTHING
 * npm has already started Node to run this launcher, so falling back is a
 * plain `import()` of the server into THIS process: no extra spawn, no extra
 * startup, byte-identical to invoking dist/index.js directly. Discovery is
 * stat-only -- never a subprocess -- so the miss case stays sub-millisecond.
 *
 * WHAT THE OAM PATH COSTS
 * Reaching oam through an npm `bin` means Node boots first and oam boots
 * second, so the launcher is slower than either runtime alone. Measured on
 * npmjs-mcp (windows-arm64, n=12 medians, spawn to first MCP initialize):
 * oam 116ms, node 172ms, launcher 243ms. oam is the fastest runtime and the
 * launcher is the slowest path -- it exists for `npx` convenience.
 *
 * For an MCP host config, point straight at oam and skip this file:
 *   { "command": "oam", "args": ["run", "<abs>/dist/index.js"] }
 *
 * SELECTION
 *   TAILSCALE_MCP_RUNTIME=oam    require oam; fail loudly if it is missing
 *   TAILSCALE_MCP_RUNTIME=node   never use oam
 *   TAILSCALE_MCP_RUNTIME=auto   prefer oam, silently fall back (default)
 *   OAM_BIN=/path/to/oam     explicit binary, checked before any discovery
